1. Dataset visualizer (Sam + Vikram)
  a) Plot cpd segmentation on the price ts + volume
  b) Plot per sample ts (returns + MACD) and other statistics to see if data is sound (e.g. to check causal relationship)

2. Backtester that works across each model plug and play style (Gabriel + Sam)
 - takes in a pytorch model, e.g. LSTM
 - will feed the model with target data
 - and in case of XTrend will also feed the model with the other assets
 - compare with target next day returns
 - vol scale at 15%
 - compute the portfolio returns over the backtesting period
 - return all relevant statistics (sharpe, turnover, rebalancing (trades made), ...)

3. Training different models with increasing complexity, starting from a very simple LSTM and gradually adding the modules until we get to the XTrend (compare backtests along the way (Sam + ...)
 - rolling window, starting from 1990-1995 (last year is reserved for validation)
 - then use model on next 5 years for backtests
 - repeat for 1995-2000, etc. and stitch backtests together
 - full backtest from 1995-2025 that we can compare each model with

4. write the report (Sam + Francesco + Vikram)
 - we start with simplest model and gradually add the results from the more sophisticated ones
 - Roadmap to XTrend
 - Document "CPD score creation"
 - Document feature creation (include volume)
 - Add new "CPD segmention" algorithm

We absolutely need to maintain good mathematical formalization of each object. Definition, Example, Proof.

We should disregard the joint losses, only focus on optimizing sharpe.

TODO for paper:

Abstract -> Refine a bit
Introduction -> good
Preliminary notation -> Add attention mechanism and make sure we are not missing any info ftom the paper
Data and feature engineering -> CHnage the plots from cartoon to nicer
Dataset overview -> Francesco will take care of explain a bit better the dataset
CPD -> check general, make sure no information forgotten, SAMUEL NEEDS TO UPDATE THE ALGO, MAKE SURE THE INPUT FEATURES MATCH THE ACTUAL ONES
Modeling approach -> figure out how you want to name it and if you want to add any extra info
Results -> do the table with the sharpe, turnover , downturn for xtrend
Contributions -> write this and write it well very important
Conclusion and future work -> write about futur work and figure out a nice conclusion.
